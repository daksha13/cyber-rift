	<p>CYBER-RIFT IS THE ONE AND ONLY IN THE WHOLE LAPTOP INDUSTRY TO COME UP WITH THIS BUSINESS
PROPOSITIION WHICH HAS MADE THE LAPTOP PURCHASING EXPERIENCE TOTALLY ALIEN FOR THE CONSUMER
BASE , SO THE EXISTENSE FOR A GUIDEBOOK WAS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE TO KEEP THE CONSUMER

	<center><h2><b>KEYBOARD</b></h2></center><p><em>KEYBOARD</em>
	FOR LAPTOPS ARE OF MAINLY 3 TYPES:
	<em>TRADITIONAL STYLE</em>,<em>CHICLET STYLE</em>,<em>MECHANICAL STYLE</em>.</p>
	<div class="rows">
		<div class="cols">
			<center>
				<h3 class="a1">TRADITIONAL STYLE</h3>
			</center>
			<div class="a" style="margin-left: 50px;">
			<p>A TRADITIONAL STYLE KEYBORAD HAS KEY CLOSE TO ONE ANOTHER WITH EACH EDGE SLOPING OFF. IT GENERALY OFFERS
				MORE SURFACE AREA AND KEY TRAVEL AND IS EASIER TO REPLACE BECAUSE THE ENTIRE KEYBOARD SITS ON A REPLACEABLE
				TRAY</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	</div>
		<div class="cols">
			<center>
				<h3 class="a1">CHICLET STYLE</h3>
					
			</center>
			<div class="a">
<p>A CHICKET STYLE OR (ISLAND STYLE) KEYBOARD HAS KEYS THAT APPEAR TO POP OUT OF THE LAPTOP'S BODY THROUGH SEPERATE CUT-OUTS
	FOR EACH KEY . KEYS ARE USUALLY FLAT AND DON'T SLOPE OFF AROUND THE EDGES. SO IT CREATES AN IMPRESSION THAT THERE IS MORE SPACE BETWEEN THE KEYS . IT ALSO MAKES CLEANING THE KEYBOARD MUCH EASIER . THE CHICLET STYLE KEYBOARD IS GRADUALLY ECLIPSING THE TRADITIONAL KEYBOARD IN LAPTOPS TODAY IT'S THINNER AND MORE VERSATILE IN DESIGN ; SO IT'S BECOMING THE KEYBOARD OF CHOICE FOR THIN AND LIGHT LAPTOP MAKERS.<em>BACKLIT KEYBOARD ARE MOSRE OFTEN CHICLET STYLE SO IF YOU ARE GOING FOR BACLIT CHOOSE THE CHICLET STYLE</em>.</p>
			</div>
		</div>
	<div class="cols">
			<center>
				<h3 class="a1">MECHANICAL STYLE</h3>
			</center>
			<div class="a" style="margin-right: 50px;">
				<p>UNLIKE TRADITIONAL OR CHICLET STYLE KEYBOARD ,WHICH USES MEMBRANE UNDER THE KEYS , A MECHANICAL KEYBOARDS EMPLOYS REAL MECHANICAL UNDER THE KEYCAPS . THE SWITCHES PRODUCE AN AUDIBLE CLICK WITH EACH, MAKING FOR INCREASED FEEDBACK . A MECHANICAL KEYBOARD IS MORE COMMONLY FOUND IN DESKTOP THAN LAPTOPS BECAUSE IT USES MORE SPACE AND MORE EXPENSIVE DESIGN .THE KEYS ON A MECHANICAL KEYBOARD TRAVEL DEEP  AND ARE TO LAST A VERY LONG
					TIME.</p>
		</div>
	</div><br><br>
	<h4><b>PRO-TIP:</b></h4>
	<p>CHANCES ARE YOU WILL COME ACROSS A CHICLET STYLE KEYBOARD ON YOUR NEXT LAPTOP , UNLESS YOU GO LOOKING SPECIFIFCALLY FOR A MECHANICAL OR TRADITIONALSTYLE KEYBOARD. IN SUCH A CASE YOU NEED TO ONLY OBSERVE THE KEYBOARD FOR TRAVEL, TACTILITY
		,OVERALL COMFORTAND KEY FUNCTIONALITY . YOU CAN'T REALLY GO WRONG WITH ANY KEYBOARD ,BUT IF YOU FIND A KEYBOARD THAT SUITS YOUR TYPING STYLE ,IT COULD BOOST  YOUR PRODUCTIVITY FIVEFOLD AND KEEP YOUR FINGERTIPS SMILLING.</p>
	<center><h2><b>GRAPHICS-CARD</b></h2></center>
	<p><ul type="circle">
	<li>A GRAPHICS CARD IS A DEDICATED CHIP INSIDE YOUR LAPTOP ,REPSONSIBLE FOR THE QUALITY OF VISUALS YOU SEE ON YOUR SCREEN.
	</li>
	<li>JUST LIKE RAM THE MORE THE GBs THE IN YOUR GRAPHICS-CARD,THE SMOOTHER YOUR GAMES WILL RUN , EVEN IN FULL HD OR 4K RESOLUTION . THE PHOTO AND VIDEO EDITING SOFTWARE LIKE PHOTOSHOP ,DESIGN SOFTWARE LIKE AUTOCAD AND OF COURSE MOST MODERN GAMES REQUIRE A DEDICATED GRAPHICS CARD TO RUN SMOOTHLY.</li></ul></p>

	</table><br><br><br><br>
	<center><h2><b>HARD DISK AND STORAGE</b></h2></center>
	<h3><b>INTERNAL STORAGE:</b></h3><br>
	<p>THIS IS ASLO REFERRED TO AS THE HARD DRIVE SIZE OR CAPACITY OF THE LAPTOP .
		STORAGE ON A LAPTOP IS WHERE THE OPERATING SYSTEMS (LIKE WINDOWS OR MAC OS) ARE INSTALLED .THIS IS ALSO WHERE ALL DOCUMENTS ,PHOTOS , APPS 	,GAMES AND MOVIES ARE STORED .<br>WITHOUT SUFFICIENT STORAGE , YOU WILL NOT BE ABLE TO STORE ANYTHING , AND IT WILL ALSO IMPACT THE SPEED PERFORMANCE .<br>
		FOR THOSE ON A BUDGET ,HDDs ARE A BETTER OPTION WHILE THOSE INTO GAMING  ARE BEST OFF CHOOSING  AN SSD .</p><br><br>
	<h4><b>USUALLY , LAPTOP STORAGE IS OF 3 TYPES: HARD DISK DRIVE(HDD),SOLID STATE DRIVE (SSD) AND SOLID STATE HYBRID DRIVE(SSHD) :</b></h4><center>
	<h3><b>INTERNAL MEMORY TYPES</b></h3></center>
	<table border="1">
		<tr><th><b>HARD DISK DRIVE</b></th><th><b>SOLID STATE DRIVE</b></th>
			<th><b>SOLID STATE HYBRID DRIVE</b></th>
			</tr>
		<tr><td>A MECHANICAL HARD DISK DRIVE(OFTEN SHORTENED HDD) IS A TYPE OF SHORTAGE WHICH GIVES GIVES YOU
			LOTS OF CAPACITY ON A BUDGET ..
			<br><br>A HDD IS CONSIDERED  SLOW BECAUSE IT HAS MOVING PARTS THAN SPIN TO READ DATA.
			</td> <td>A SOLID STATE DRIVE (SOMETIMES CALLED SSD)IS A TYPE OF DRIVE THAT IS FASTER , BUT ALSO MORE EXPENSIVE ,THAN 
			HDDs<br>SSDs CAN START UP WINDOWS IN LESS THAN 5 SECONDS .<br><br>PROGRAMS WILL RUN FASTER IF YOU ARE A SSD.<br><br>
			HOWERVER ALL THIS PERFORMANCE COMES AT A HIGHER PRICE.</td><td>SSHD IS A COMBINATION OF HDD AND SSD WHICH NOT ONLY MEANS YOU GET STORAGE SPACE BUT EVERYTHING LOADS FASTER TOO<br>
			<br>EXAMPLE: A SSHD UNIT COULD HAVE A 128GB SSD PAIRED WITH A 500 GB OR 1TB HDD .<br><br>
			THE OPERATING SYSTEM WILL BE INSTALLED ON THE SSD ALONG WITH OTHER PROGRAMS WHILE THE HDD PART IS USED TO STORE DOCUMENTS ,MOVIES ETC. THIS MEANS THAT YOUR OS AND PROGRAMS START UP FASTER.</td></tr>
	</table><br><br><br>
	<center><h2><b>RAM</b></h2></center>
	<h3>MORE RAM = BETTER MULTITASKING</h3>
	<p>RAM STANDS FOR RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY AND IS WHAT STORES ALL OPEN APPS ,FILESAND GAMES YOU MAY BE PLAYING <br><br>
		MORE RAM ALLOWS MORE OF THEM TO BE RUNNING SIMULTANEOUSLY.<br>
	TYPICALLY A LAPTOP COMES WITH A 4,8,16GB OF RAM .</p>
	<h3>RAM TYPES:</h3>
	<p>DDR4: FASTER , EFFICEINT POWER CONSUMPTION</p>
	<p>DDR3: OLDER,SLOWER AND MORE POWER CONSUMPTION</p>
	<h3>UPGRADABILTY:</h3>
	<p>WITH TIME, THE APPLICATIONS AND THE OPERATING SYSTEM YOU WILL USE WILL BE UPGRADEDTO NEWER VERSIONS AND WOULD NEED MORE RAM. THIS MAY CAUSE SOME SLOW DOWN IN PERFORMANCE OR THE SYSTEM TO HANG FREQUENTLY.<br>
	THIS IS WHEN UPGRADING THE RAM CAN KEEP THE LAPTOP USABLE FOR LONGER , ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE BOUGHT A LAPTOP ITH JUST 4 GB RAM </p>
	<br><br><br><center>
	<h2><b>DISPLAY</b></h2></center><h3>
 <p>WHILE CHOOSING THE RIGHT DISPLAY FOR YOUR LAPTOP , YOU WILL NEED TO DECIDE THE RIGHT SCREEN SIZE , AND THE RIGHT RESOLUTION FOR YOUR USAGE .</p></h3>
	<h3>SCREEN SIZE</h3>
	<p>SCREENS COME IN MANY SIZES, ALL MEASURED DIAGONALLY. THE MOST COMMON SIZE IS 15.6 INCHES BUT THERE ARE ASLO 11 INCH, 13INCH  AND SCREEN SIZES , GOING UP TO 17.3 INCHES ON SOME HARDCORE GAMING LAPTOPS .<br>  A LARGER SCREEN SIZE IS IDEAL FOR GAMING, WATCHING MOVIES , PHOTO OR VIDEO EDITING  AND COMPLEX DATA VISUALIZATION ; WHILE SMALL SIZE SCREEN IS  LIGHTER AND IS EASIER TO CARRY  AROUND.<br>DO REMEMBER THE , HEAVIER THE LAPTOP . THIS BECAUSE OF ALL THE GLASS THAT GOES IN TO MAKING THE 	DISPLAY,WHICH HAS TO BE MADE DURABLE AND HENCE, THE ADDED WEIGHT.</p>
	<h3>PRO TIP : IF YOU NEED TO CARRY YOU LAPTOP A LOT THEN , THEN CONSIDER A LAPTOP WITH A DISPLAY BETWEEN 11 TO 14 INCHES.</h3><br><br>
